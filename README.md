# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I am Wayne Logan. ðŸ˜Š
I am a **fullstack JavaScript web developer**

ðŸ“š My tech stask is MERN
  - MongoDB
  - Express JS
  - React JS
  - Next JS
 
Beyond JavaScript, I am competent in the following tools
  - TypeScript
  - SASS
  - Git (Duuuh! I'm using GitHub ðŸ˜‚)
  - GitHub actions
  - CI/CD
  - Firebase

I have been programming since 2020 when I did my diploma in IT. Right now, I am a fulltime Electrical and Electronics Engineering student.

I am currently curating my GitHub to showcase my developer skillset and land a job (finally).

ðŸ“« If you are a recruiter, fellow freelancer or opensource developer **feel welcome to reach out** to me at loganamollo@gmail.com

I am an avid learner and ardent problem solver willing to commit (git pun) to a (part time) job from which I hope to learn and grow.
